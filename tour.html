      <p>Bakasihan is a humble eatery specializing in eel among other seafood that can make you hungry even if you are not. Cordova is one of the places in Cebu famous for seafoods, especially a certain kind of fish known as 'bakasi'. I am not a fan of bakasi but it tastes just right for me. But anyone who is a fan of seafood, never miss out Cordova. Cordova is one of the places in Cebu famous for seafoods, especially a certain kind of fish known as 'bakasi'.
